In URTouch.cpp:
	Added InitTouch function variant that allows the three screen calibration parameters to be directly passed instead of loading them from URTouchCD.h
	Added 1 microsecond delays after each call and read from the screen when using a Teensy 3.5/3.6 to slow the processing and avoid touch reading problems.
In URTouch.h:
	Added declaration for InitTouch function variant

Library retains all original functionality.

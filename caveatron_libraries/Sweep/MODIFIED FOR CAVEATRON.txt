Sweep Library Modifications for Caveatron

For Caveatron Firmware 0.9g, 0.95a and newer
Joe Mitchell

In Sweep.cpp:
	Modified getReadings function to add capability to compute checksum and compare to received checksum for each packet. If checksum fails, the function returns false, and in the ScanPacket, bIsSync set to true with the other values set to 0.

Library retains all original functionality.
